Mininet hosts run standard Linux network software, and its switches support OpenFlow for highly flexible custom routing and Software-Defined Networking. (http://mininet.org/) Its version 1.0 is over 15 years old.\n",
        "- (Again in their own words) Mininet-WiFi is a fork of the Mininet SDN network emulator and extended the functionality of Mininet by adding virtualized WiFi Stations and Access Points based on the standard Linux wireless drivers and the 80211_hwsim wireless simulation driver.\n",

        "With MiniNet-Wifi it is quite easy to generate complex network topologies including fixed nodes such as hosts, switches, routers as well as WiFi access points and stations with mobility. It is possible to use various propagation models to emulate network characteristics in different environments. Please consult https://mininet-wifi.github.io and access the ebook at https://mininet-wifi.github.io/book/ or even purchase it.\n",
